Editor Group:

This is where I see the code. It contains one or more editor tabs.
I could split the editor into multiple groups to work on different files at the same time.
Status Bar:

It's at the bottom and shows information about the current file, Git branch, and provides access to features like language mode, indentation settings, line endings, etc.


4. Command Palette:
   - What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.
